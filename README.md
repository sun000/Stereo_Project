# Stereo

I have Implement the Zhang's Method of camera calibrate.

My code can calculate the intrinsics and the extrinsics accurately!

There may stillbe some bugs about distortion coeï¬ƒcients In my implement method. I will solve them as soon  as possible.

### How to Run

##### First you need some packages: 

* opencv 
* numpy 

The code is /Code/main.py

I write my code in Pycharm, you can open it in PyCharm and run it. 

**PS: My code need Python 3.5. because my opencv package can't  support higher python version.**



If you want to know more about my code, you can see code. There are some node for you to understand my code.
